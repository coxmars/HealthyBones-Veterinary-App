## Project Status
Project is: Progress, the app is finished but some changes can be aplied to improve several functionalities.


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Implement forgot password functionality which is essential in Apps these days.
- Set roles for the users and apply authorization for them. 
- Validate account creation with an email with the purpose of decrease boots, inactive users etc.

To do:
- Nothing for the correct functionality of the app, but as I said maybe some changes to improve the app for being more realistic or productivity as a real tool.
